# Platformer Paradise v2.alpha

Welcome to my first ever platformer game project! While it's still a work in progress, I decided to upload it here to track its development and share my journey with others. This game is built solely using standard Java libraries. It's been a fun and educational experience, and I'm excited to continue improving it.

## About the Project
This project represents my initial foray into game development. Although itâ€™s still in its early stages, the foundation is solid. I'm continually learning and refining my skills as I go. I haven't settled on a final name for the game yet, but that will come in time.

## Features Implemented

Here are the features that have been completed in this version:

1. **Better Game Loop**: Made the game loop better.
2. **Player Class**: Made a Player class that inherits the entity class (which would be used for other entities in game, like the enemies).
