# Lost Isles – First Playable Beta Release (v1.beta)

I am excited to announce the first beta release of *Lost Isles*! The transition from v8.alpha to v1.beta marks a significant milestone in the game’s development. After nearly a month of focused work on gameplay mechanics, enemy design, and overall functionality, we now have a working game ready for testing.

## Key Updates:
Several new features and improvements have been introduced in this version, including:
- **Health and Power Bars:** These have been added to track the player's status during gameplay.
- **Enemies:** We have introduced enemies.
- **Patrolling Enemies:** Enemies now move along designated paths.
- **Enemy Attacks:** Enemies are equipped with various attacks.
- **Attackboxes:** Both the player and enemies now feature attackboxes to ensure accurate hit detection and combat mechanics.
- **Added Levels (In Progress):** Three levels have been designed and will be implemented soon.
- **Reset Screen:** A reset screen has been added for player convenience.
- **Bug Fixes:** Numerous bugs have been resolved to improve gameplay experience.

## Next Steps:
My next priority is the implementation of the level system. With some groundwork already in place, I would be releasing the new version very soon.
