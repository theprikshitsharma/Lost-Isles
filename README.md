# Platformer Paradise v5.alpha

I’ve now got the main character in place and nailed down the theme. I was using a placeholder before, but the new character fits the theme perfectly and has an awesome backstory. Plus, I’ve decided on the game’s name!

You can check out the character’s image in the "character.png" file in this branch. For the full lore and more details, head over to the main branch.
## Features Implemented

Here are the features that have been completed in this version:

1. **Theme Finalisation:** This version focused primarily on finalizing the theme, main character, and environment, which have been decided after considerable thought. The updated theme is now live on the main branch of the repository.
2. **Game States:** I’ve implemented game states, including a pause menu (still in development) and the main gameplay state.
3. **Bug Fixes:** Addressed and resolved issues with tile clipping. The game is currently free of bugs.
