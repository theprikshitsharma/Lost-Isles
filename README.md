# Platformer Paradise v1.alpha

Welcome to my first ever platformer game project! While it's still a work in progress, I decided to upload it here to track its development and share my journey with others. This game is built solely using standard Java libraries. It's been a fun and educational experience, and I'm excited to continue improving it.

## Features Implemented

Here are the features that have been completed in this version:

1. **Basic File Setup**: Organized the project structure and files.
2. **Input Handling**: Integrated keyboard and mouse input handling.
3. **Game Loop**: Established a game loop to manage updates and rendering.
4. **Images and Animations**: Added basic image and animation support.
