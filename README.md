# Platformer Paradise v3.alpha

Welcome to my first ever platformer game project! While it's still a work in progress, I decided to upload it here to track its development and share my journey with others. This game is built solely using standard Java libraries. It's been a fun and educational experience, and I'm excited to continue improving it.

## About the Project
This project represents my initial foray into game development. Although itâ€™s still in its early stages, the foundation is solid. I'm continually learning and refining my skills as I go. I haven't settled on a final name for the game yet, but that will come in time.

## Features Implemented

Here are the features that have been completed in this version:

### 1.Collision Detection
The collision system has been made more accurate, so characters now interact more naturally with obstacles and other elements in the game.
### 2.Gravity System
A new gravity system has been added, making characters' movements like falling and jumping more realistic.
### 3.Minor Tweaks and Optimizations
Small improvements have been made to the code to enhance overall game performance and stability.
