# Platformer Paradise v3.alpha

## Features Implemented

Here are the features that have been completed in this version:

1. **Collision Detection**: Added collision detection to the game, making it fully playable and enhancing interactions.
2. **Gravity System**: Implemented gravity so the player falls after jumping and responds to gaps in the tiles.
3. **Minor Tweaks and Optimizations**: Small improvements have been made to the code to enhance overall game performance and stability.

## Bugs Fixed

**Fixed "No Gravity After Jump" Bug**: The character would lag and sometimes remain in the air after landing from a previous jump (see "Video_1" for reference). This bug has been fixed, and the character now moves smoothly (showcased in "Video_2").
**Fixed Running Animation Bug**: The running animations were lagging and unclear, but I have fixed the issue, and they are now working smoothly.

## Developer's Note
This version took longer than I expected for a few reasons. First, my grandpa passed away, so I was occupied with family gatherings. Then, my second year of college started, and I almost forgot about the game until my friend asked about the progress. After that, I returned to work and completed this version. I plan to focus on different game states in the next version.
