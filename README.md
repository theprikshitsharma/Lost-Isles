# Platformer Paradise 

Welcome to my first ever platformer game project! While it's still a work in progress, I decided to upload it here to track its development and share my journey with others. This game is built solely using standard Java libraries. It's been a fun and educational experience, and I'm excited to continue improving it.

## About the Project
This project represents my initial foray into game development. Although itâ€™s still in its early stages, the foundation is solid. I'm continually learning and refining my skills as I go. I haven't settled on a final name for the game yet, but that will come in time.
## This is still a work in progress, I will keep updating this file after every new version
