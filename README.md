# Platformer Paradise v8.alpha


## Features Implemented

Here are the features that have been completed in this version:

**1.Bigger Levels:** The levels are now larger, allowing for movement through them. Instead of a static level, the screen now moves along with the character.

**2.Background Images:** Added background images to the main screen and throughout the game (check out the showcase).

**3.Bug Fixes:** Fixed a bug where holding both "A" and "D" keys at the same time caused the animation to run, but the character would not move.

## Dev Notes
This update was a significant step forward in our journey. The implementation part was quite challenging, but I managed to complete it. Next, I will be adding enemies.
